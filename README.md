sizzle
======

Sizzle improves the experience of your favorite sites

My idea is to _eventually_ support user contributed scripts from a
widget to allow easy management and discovery of enhancements for the
page loaded in your browser.

**Right now, this is absolutely a work in progress, and the base of my research
into FF SDK/Jetpack plugin development.**

Current Experiments
-------------------

* Highlight the sizzling posts when viewing a Tumblr blog's archive
* finance.yahoo.com tweaks
* preference management


sdk setup
=========

* install and activate the SDK
  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation
